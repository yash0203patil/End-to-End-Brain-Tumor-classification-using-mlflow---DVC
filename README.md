### End-to-End Brain Tumor Classification using MLflow & DVC

Welcome to our Brain Tumor Classification project! In this repository, we provide an end-to-end solution for classifying brain tumors using MLflow and DVC. Our project leverages these powerful tools to streamline the machine learning workflow, making it easier to manage experiments, track model performance, and version control data and models.

#### Workflows

Our project follows a structured workflow to ensure seamless development and deployment:

1. **Update Configuration Files**: Modify configuration files as needed.
   
2. **Update Entity**: Update the entity associated with the project.
   
3. **Update Configuration Manager**: Adjust the configuration manager to reflect any changes in the project configuration.
   
4. **Update Components**: Modify components as necessary to enhance functionality.
   
5. **Update Pipeline**: Keep the pipeline up to date with the latest changes.
   
6. **Update Main Script**: Update `main.py` with any new features or bug fixes.
   
7. **Update DVC Configuration**: Make changes to `dvc.yaml` to manage data versions and dependencies effectively.

#### Dataset
